		<p>The Virginia Department of Social Services Intranet site, know internally as SPARK, serves over 13,000 employees in state and local branches of the agency.  This site is one of the agency's most critical systems.  It not only houses all of the internal forms and documentation for the agency but also serves as a portal to many of the online systems used throughout the agency.</p>
		<p>Upon my arrival to the agency, I learned that their current web developer resigned without notice leaving them with a huge deficit in the agency.  This not only placed me in a position of urgency but also one without guidance as there was no documentation created to guide the site maintenance.  I discovered that the site was using a homegrown CMS coded with a mix of HTML, CGI and Perl.  My first thought was that this needed to be updated to newer technologies; however, that was set as a long term plan.  In the meantime, I needed to determine how the site functioned and perform the backlog of updates needed by the agency.  Over the period of a few weeks, I was able to determine much of the site's functionality and begin to tackle to backlog of updates needed.  Within a couple months, I moved towards my specialty of design and kicked off with a minor face lift to the site.  This design changed was a simple rewrite of the styling of the current site utilizing it's current infrastructure with a few extras sprinkled on top.</p>
		<p>Although a blessing to the staff, this was just a stop gap measure as I moved the department to the future. A new backend developer was brought aboard and after reviewing multiple vendors we selected Evoque to replace the current SPARK.  The new intranet would now be called Inside VDSS and bring all new features and functionality for the agency.  In the current system, editors of the site can only upload files into predefined areas as unordered list.  In this new system, the editors would have full control over their site's content and structure.  As easily as it would be to type a Word document they can create new pages and edit them as need be.  I will serve as the lead designer for the new site and also assist in the customization and development of the new CMS.  I've included a few options for the new site's design in the right-side bar.  We are currently still in the initial implementation phases so not much more can be said, but updates will be added as son as they are available.<p>
