			<h2>Child Care as a Profession</h2>
			<p>More  than half of the U.S population consists of working parents with children under  the age of 6 and require child care services outside of their home. The Virginia  Department of Social Services (VDSS) understands that choosing a safe, quality  childcare provider or facility can be an overwhelming task for parents.  VDSS is committed to providing parents  with the highest quality child care programs in Virginia, staffed with caring,  knowledgeable, nurturing and dedicated individuals. <strong> </strong>As  a child care professional, you can be a part of Virginia&rsquo;s commitment to  providing safe, quality child care! </p>
		  <p> As a child care professional you  most likely work for a child day program. Child day programs are defined as regularly-operating service arrangement for children where, during the absence of a  parent or guardian, a person or organization has agreed to assume  responsibility for the supervision, protection and well-being of a child under  the age of 13 years for less than a 24-hour period.</p>
		    <p>In Virginia, there are two types of child day programs for which you may work: child day centers (center-based) and family day homes (family-based). </p>
		    <h4>Child Day Centers</h4>
            <p>Child day centers provide care for (i)  two or more children under the age of 13 years in a facility that is not the  residence of the provider or of any of the children in care or (ii) 13 or more  children at any location. </p>
            <h4>Family Day Homes</h4>
            <p>Family day-homes provide care in  the residence of the provider or the home of any of the children in care for up to 12 children under the age of 13 years, not including the provider's own children and any children who  reside in the home, when at least one child receives care for compensation.<strong> </strong></p>
            <div>
            </div>
<h4>Requirements for Becoming a Child Care Professional</h4>
          <p>As a child care professional in Virginia, you will be required to meet certain standards to ensure your level of knowledge and competency. Qualifications will vary based on the type of program.</p>

<h4>How do I get my  program licensed with the state?</h4>
          <p>Applicants are <strong><u>required</u></strong> to attend the Pre-licensure Orientation-Phase 2 training provided by the Virginia  Department of Social Services (VDSS) that includes an overview of the <em>Code of  Virginia</em>, regulations, completing the application, licensee responsibilities,  inspections/role of the licensing inspector, and program requirements. Applicants  are provided with specific information on health and safety standards and  required background checks. <br>
            Applicants are encouraged to contact their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/contact_us/dolp_district.pdf">regional  licensing office</a> or call the toll-free licensing information line at:  800–543–7545 if they have any questions about licensing and the licensing  process.<br>
            <br>
            For more information on becoming licensed, you can also contact your <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/contact_us/dolp_district.pdf.">regional  licensing office</a>.</p>
          <p><small>Note: A general business license to operate from the county within which the provider conducts business is not the same as a child day care license obtained from the Virginia Department of Social Services (VDSS), which holds the child day care provider accountable to the health and safety standards set forth by the Commonwealth of Virginia.</small></p>

              <p>Information  regarding inspections is found within the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/licensing/cdc/intro_page/current_providers/guidance_procedures/protocol_for_inspections_at_licensed_child_day_programs.pdf"><strong><em>Protocol for Inspections Licensed  Child Day Programs</em></strong></a>. </p>

                <div> </div>
              </div>
              <p>There are 6 basic components of an inspection: </p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Entrance  Conference</strong> – Inspectors introduce themselves briefly, <u>explain</u> the  inspection process, and ask for any items  needed to conduct the inspection.</li>
                <li><strong>Tour </strong>– Inspectors walk through the  building(s) directly after the entrance conference to observe activities and  personal interactions, talk to children and staff, examine the physical plant,  and check on general health and hygiene issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactions and Interviews</strong> – Inspectors speak to children, parents  (either during or after an inspection), staff members, and interview the  program director to gather information on compliance with Standards, especially  those relating to care and services to children. </li>
                <li><strong>Observations </strong>– In order to thoroughly assess compliance with Standards, observations will begin from the moment the inspector drives up to the building until the conclusion of the inspection, when the inspector leaves the property. Inspectors pay special attention to the interactions between staff and children, the execution of the program’s internal policies and procedures, and the learning and recreational activities observed.  </li>
                <li><strong>Documentation Review</strong> – Inspectors conduct a focused examination of child and staff records, key Standards, and information gathered during interviews and observations.</li>
                <li><strong>Exit Meeting</strong> – Inspectors review the results of the inspection with the provider, listen to and discuss any disputed findings and/or comments about the inspection process, provide consultation, and request a plan of correction for any violations found during the inspections.</li>
              </ol>

          <h2 >Become a Subsidy Provider</h2>
          <p>The Virginia Department of Social Services  (VDSS), in partnership with the local departments of social services,  administer the Child Care Subsidy Program which provides financial assistance  to eligible families to help pay a portion of the cost of child care so they  can work or participate in education or training programs.  Program services are child-centered and family  focused and support the broader objective of strengthening families&rsquo; goals of  self-sufficiency and enrolling children in quality early childhood programs.   Approved Subsidy providers partner with VDSS  to carry out the objectives of the program.        </p>
<h4>How to Become a  Subsidy Provider</h4>
          <p>When a family is approved to receive subsidy assistance they  are able to choose any legally operating provider of child care services.  All providers who wish to receive subsidy  payments must complete the Subsidy Vendor Enrollment Process.<br>
            For providers who are licensed or regulated by the VDSS  Division of Licensing Programs, this process is initiated when a family selects  a child care provider.  The case manager  will make a referral to the Subsidy Unit within the Division of Child Care and  Early Childhood Development to begin the enrollment process.</p>
          <p><strong>Licensed and Regulated  Providers</strong><br>
For providers who are  licensed or regulated by the VDSS Division of Licensing – Children&rsquo;s Programs,  this process is initiated when a family participating in the Subsidy Program selects  a child care provider. The case manager in the local department of social  services will make a referral to the Subsidy Unit within the VDSS Division of  Child Care and Early Childhood Development to begin the enrollment process.  The process may require the provider to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Complete a VDSS Child Care Subsidy Program  Vendor Agreement Packet</li>
            <li>Provide other information that may be  needed</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Unlicensed and  Unregistered Providers</strong><br>
            Unlicensed and  unregulated providers will be referred by the case manager in the local department of social  services to Child Care Aware of Virginia (CCA-VA).&nbsp;The provider will be  contacted directly by CCA –VA to begin the enrollment process.<br>
            The process may require the provider to:</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>Complete a       VDSS Child Care Subsidy Program Vendor Agreement Packet&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
            <li>Provide       valid CPR and First Aid Certifications</li>
            <li>Submit to       a Virginia State Police Background Check</li>
            <li>Submit to       a VDSS Child Protective Services Central Registry Check</li>
            <li>Complete a       VDSS Health &amp; Safety Checklist</li>
            <li>Provide       documentation of required annual skills training</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Benefits to Becoming  a Subsidy Provider</h4>
          <p>Any legally operating child care provider may choose to  become an approved Subsidy Provider!<br>
Subsidy  Providers are <strong><em>choosing</em></strong> to make a difference for children,  families and the community by serving low-income families who are working or  attending an approved school or training program.&nbsp; <br>
Becoming a Subsidy provider creates opportunities to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Make a difference by delivering services that  allow parents to work and stay (or become) self-sufficient</li>
            <li>Make a difference by providing healthy, safe  and quality environments where children  spend a significant number of hours each week, which has a direct impact on  their development and well-being</li>
            <li>Receive payments for the Subsidy children you  serve through convenient and regular direct deposits to your banking account or  a debit card </li>
            <li>Use your approved Subsidy Provider status as  a marketing tool to solicit and educate prospective parents</li>
            <li>Influence parents with online health and  safety inspection reports</li>
            <li>Access relevant, up-to-date training and  resources</li>
            <li>Receive federal and state child care news and updates through email blasts</li>
          </ul>
          <div>
            <div> </div>
          </div>
<h4>Subsidy Payment Levels</h4>
          <p>The Child Care Subsidy  Program does a statewide survey every 3 years to gather information about the rates charged by child care providers.  This information is used to help set the  payment rates for the Subsidy Program.  In  general, licensed providers are paid by the Subsidy Program at a rate higher  than unlicensed providers.  </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Level 1 - Unlicensed providers are  considered to be &ldquo;Level 1&rdquo; providers.  Voluntarily  registered family day homes, religious exempt centers, certified preschools,  local government approved recreation programs and in home providers who are not  licensed or regulated by VDSS are included in this group.  </li>
            <li>            Level 2 – Licensed  providers are considered to be &ldquo;Level 2&rdquo; providers.  Providers who are licensed by VDSS or are approved  and/or operated by a Licensed Family Day System, the Department of Education,  the Department of Defense, or under local ordinance according to §15.2-914 of  the <em>Code of Virginia </em>are included in this group. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The payment amounts  received by providers for services provided depend on the provider level and  also the type of care (center or family day home).  The payment rates and amounts for all Subsidy  providers are determined by VDSS.  Level 2  providers are eligible to receive payment for absences, holidays and  registration fees.  <br>

          <h2>New Provider Requirements </h2>
			<p>There  are several new requirements for family day home providers. <br>
          <h4> Family Day Home Licensure  Threshold Change</h4>
<p>Effective July 1, 2016, licensure threshold  limits will beupdated. Family Day Home providers are now required to  obtain a state-issued license from the Virginia Department of Social Services  (VDSS) when caring for more than 4 children (this does not include the  provider&rsquo;s biological children or other children who legally reside in the  home).&nbsp; If the family day home provider cares for more than 4 children  under the age of &nbsp;2 , including the provider&rsquo;s biological children and  children who legally reside in the home, the family day home provider must  possess a state-issued licensed or a voluntarily registered certificate from  VDSS.</p>
  <p><em>*</em><strong>Note</strong><em>: If all are the biological children of the  provider, meaning related to the provider by blood or marriage, the home is not  required to be licensed.</em></p>
<h4>Written Notice to  Parents, Unlicensed Family Day Homes</h4>

<p>Effective July 1, 2015, if a family day  home provider does not have a state-issued license or a voluntarily registered  certificate from VDSS, parents must be notified, in writing, that the home is  not regulated by VDSS, and a link to the  VDSS website is provided for parents to obtain additional information regarding  licensure.&nbsp;(<a target="_blank" href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title63.2/chapter17/section63.2-1704.1/" target="_blank">Code  of Virginia, Section 63.2-1704.1</a>)
<h4>Sex  Offender Prohibited in a Family Day Home</h4>
         <p>Effective July 1, 2015, per<a target="_blank" href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title63.2/chapter17/section63.2-1727/" target="_blank"> § 63.2-1727</a> of  the Code of Virginia,&nbsp;it is unlawful to operate a family day home &nbsp;if  the provider or any household member, employee, or volunteer in the family day  home has been convicted of any offense that requires registration in the Sex  Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry. It is recommended but not required  that providers search the <a target="_blank" href="https://sex-offender.vsp.virginia.gov/sor/" target="_blank">Virginia Sex Offender Registry</a> to  determine if an individual is listed, and print out the results of the search.  If you are unsure if a crime requires registration, visit the<a target="_blank" href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/licensing/fdh/intro_page/background_investigations/guidance_procedures/convictions.pdf" target="_blank"> VDSS website</a> for a  list of convictions that are required to be reported. </p>

<h2>Training &amp; Professional Development</h2>
            <p>A skilled and well-trained  workforce is essential to providing high-quality early care and education  services to children and their families.&nbsp;Through professional development,  child care providers acquire knowledge and skills needed to plan and implement  quality early learning experiences.&nbsp;If you are a child care provider  looking for professional development opportunities, the Virginia Department of  Social Services (VDSS) offers a variety of training, education, and resources  to help you earn the continuing education and training needed to be successful  in the early childhood and school-age care workforce.</p>

                <h4>Inspection of early  care and education programs</h4>
                <p>The Virginia  Department of Social Services inspects licensed programs prior to operation,  bi-annually, as needed for program development, and in response to complaints.  The bi-annual mandated inspections are unannounced. <br>
                  Regulated programs  that are unlicensed are inspected accordingly: </p>

                <h4>How to tell if a child care program is  operating illegally</h4>
                <p>A child day provider may have a business license issued by a locality,  but <strong>a business license is not the same  as a license issued by the Department of Social Services</strong>.</p>
                <p>Child  day centers are  child day programs offered to (i) two or more children under the age of 13  years in a facility that is not the residence of the provider or of any of the  children in care or (ii) 13 or more children at any location. Child day centers  must be either<strong> licensed </strong>or<strong> exempt from licensure.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A center <u>may</u> be  operating illegally if:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A current license or exemption letter  cannot be produced; or</li>
                  <li>There are more children in care than  are allowed by the license or exemption letter. Ask the center to show you their license or letter of exemption issued  by VDSS.  </li>
                  <li><strong>Licensed family day homes</strong> may provide care for <strong>six to twelve children</strong> (exclusive of  the provider's own children and any children who reside in the home) when at  least one child receives care for compensation. The care may be offered in the  home of the provider or in the home of any of the children in care. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>A family day home <u>may</u> be operating illegally if:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A current license cannot be produced; </li>
                  <li>The provider or someone who resides in  the home is identified as a sex offender or child abuser;</li>
                  <li>There are more children in care than are  allowed by the license; or</li>
                  <li>There are more than four children under  the age of two, including the provider&rsquo;s own children or any children who  reside in the home. Ask the family day home provider to show you their license  issued by VDSS.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong><u>Voluntarily Registered</u></strong><u> <strong>family  day homes</strong></u> are not  required to be licensed, but may choose to be registered. These homes have  fewer than six children in care, not including the provider's own children and  any children who reside in the home. Voluntary registration is not available in  areas where local ordinances regulate unlicensed providers (Arlington, Fairfax,  and Alexandria). <br>
                  <strong>A voluntarily registered family day home <u>may</u> be operating  illegally if:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A current registration letter cannot be  produced; </li>
                  <li>The provider or someone who resides in  the home is identified as a child abuser or is registered as a sex offender; or </li>
                  <li>There are more children in care than  are allowed by the registration letter. Ask the family day home provider to  show you their voluntary registration letter issued by VDSS.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong><u>Certified preschools</u></strong> operated  by private schools that are accredited by a statewide accrediting organization  (or another accrediting organization recognized by the Board of Education) are  allowed by <a target="_blank" href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title63.2/chapter17/section63.2-1717/">Section 63.2-1717</a> of the Code of Virginia to be exempt from  licensure. In its request for certification, the preschool must specify whether  it meets subsection B, C or D of that section of the Code of Virginia. <br>
                  <strong>A certified preschool <u>may</u> be operating illegally if:</strong></p>
