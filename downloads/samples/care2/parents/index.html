		  <h2>Why Quality Matters</h2>
			<p>All  parents want to support their child&rsquo;s health, happiness and development.  Choosing quality child care is an excellent way to do this! A quality child  care program promotes a safe, fun environment where children can PLAY, LEARN  and LAUGH! </p>
			<p>Research tells us that  90% of brain development occurs in the first five years of life, and what  children experience in these early years (see, hear, smell, taste and feel)  shapes their brains. High quality child care programs feature enriched  experiences that are linked to greater achievement and success in school and in  life.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Quality Child Care:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <!--<li>Have  qualified, trained and experienced staff</li>-->
              <li>Impact  how children learn, think, develop and behave</li>
              <li>Promote  social and emotional skills</li>
              <li>Encourage  curiosity and cultivate a love of learning</li>
              <li>Prepare  children for school </li>
              <!--<li>Ensure an organized, clean and safe  environment (inside and out)</li>
              <li>Provide proper adult-to-child ratios ensuring  appropriate supervision</li>-->
            </ul>
            <!--<p>Adhere  to state regulations and guidelines<strong></strong></p>-->
              <p><strong>Indicators  of Quality Child Care</strong></p>

          <ul>
              <li><strong>Relationships and Interactions</strong>
                          <p>Skillful adults provide warm, responsive relationships that foster  confidence as they respond to children&rsquo;s needs consistently. Adults engage in  culturally and linguistically appropriate conversations with the children, and  are respectful and supportive of each child and their family.</p>
                          </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>
					<strong>Staff Qualifications and Training</strong>
                    <p>Knowledgeable adults structure the environment to provide maximum  opportunities for children to learn.   Teachers who are better prepared are more likely to engage in positive  interactions, plan developmentally appropriate activities, and use feedback to  develop strong relationships.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>
					<strong>Play and Learning:</strong>
                    <p>The curriculum is age appropriate,  supported by a variety of toys and materials, and promotes learning and  development in all areas. There is a written plan that outlines the educational  goals, activities, materials, assessment, and daily schedule.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>
					<strong>Health and Safety</strong>
                    <p>A quality child care program puts health and safety first. The  environment is organized, clean and safe (inside and out), toys and equipment  are monitored and cleaned daily, and safe health practices, such as hand washing,  are consistently followed. A high quality program will also promote nutrition and  exercise to support healthy development.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>
					<strong>Low Ratios and Group Size</strong>
                    <p>The number of children a caregiver is responsible for can be  described as a ratio. A 3:1 ratio means there are 3 children per caregiver.  Group size refers to the total number of children per class, program or home.  Typically the fewer the children in relation to caregivers, the greater  the supervision. </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

              <h4>What is the difference between licensed  versus unlicensed and unregistered care?</h4>
              <p> Licensed  child day care programs can be offered in a child day center or in a family day  home.  They have initial and unannounced annual inspections.  Additional inspections are conducted as a  result of violations and/or complaints. They have requirements for background  checks, education, training/orientation, and health and safety standards.</p>
              <p>Unlicensed and unregistered  child day care programs <strong><em><u>do not</u></em></strong> have any of the following requirements or safeguards to protect vulnerable  children: background checks, training/orientation, or health and safety  requirements; and only minimal Code of Virginia requirements apply.</p>
              <h4>Why should I use a licensed care  provider? <br>
              </h4>
              <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/cc/guidance_parents/choosing_qcc/Eng_-_choosing-quality-childcare_brochure_small.pdf">Choosing quality child care</a> is one of the most important decisions  you&rsquo;ll ever make as a parent. Licensing is the first step in quality care.  Quality child care impacts how children learn, think, develop and behave;  promotes social and emotional skills; promotes self-esteem and confidence;  encourages curiosity and love of learning; prepares children for school; strengthens  math and reading skills; and increases probability of attending college.</p>
             <p> When you select a licensed care provider in Virginia, you  are selecting a qualified professional in the field of early education with a  commitment to providing a safe and healthy environment for children by  demonstrating compliance with regulations.</p>
             <h4>Who inspects early care and education  programs?
             </h4>
             <p>The Virginia Department of Social Services inspects <strong>licensed</strong> programs prior to operation, bi-annually, as needed for program development,  and in response to complaints. The bi-annual mandated inspections are  unannounced. <br>
Regulated programs that are unlicensed are inspected accordingly: </p>
             <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/licensing/recdc/intro_page/applicants/guidance_procedures/information_for_religiously_exempt_child_day_centers.pdf"><strong><em>Religious Exempt</em></strong></a> child day centers are inspected by  VDSS when there is a report of a complaint and/or allegation. </p>
             <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/licensing/vrfdh/intro_page/code_regulations/regulations/vr_regulation.pdf"><strong><em>Voluntarily Registered </em></strong></a><strong></strong>homes are inspected by VDSS prior to issuance of an initial  certificate and prior to issuing a renewal inspection.&nbsp; Registered homes  are inspected when there is a report of a complaint and/or allegation. Annual  monitoring inspections are conducted on a random sampling of homes by contract  agency staff and/or Virginia Department of Social Services staff.  </p>
             <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/licensing/fds/intro_page/code_regulations/regulations/final_fds_reg_071713.pdf"><strong><em>Family Day System </em></strong></a><strong></strong>is operated by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.infanttoddler.com">Infant/Toddler Family Day Care</a> and they are inspected by VDSS.  Individual family day homes approved under  the umbrella of the system are directly inspected by the family day system on a  quarterly basis to  ensure compliance with the system's policies and procedures. At least two  visits are required to be unannounced. </p>
             <h4>How do I find out about inspection  reports or violations?
             </h4>
             <p>Inspection reports are available for licensed and  religious exempt child day centers, licensed and voluntarily registered family  day homes, and certified preschools. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/facility/search/cc.cgi">Click  here.</a></p>
              <p> To view inspection reports enter the necessary  information of the facility or home and activate the search, the programs  information will be displayed. In addition to the program&rsquo;s contact  information, the assigned inspector and license information is displayed. </p>
              <p> Inspection reports are posted with the most recent  inspection displayed first. Details of the inspection reports highlights the  areas reviewed, technical assistance provided during the inspection, and the  inspector&rsquo;s comments. Specific information on violations are available and  include specific standard numbers, description of the violation, and the  center&rsquo;s response and/or corrective action if provided. </p>
             <p> Parents who would like to file a complaint regarding a  violation of a health and safety standard and/or citizens who would like to  report an allegation of an illegally operating facility may do so by completing  the Division of Licensing – Children&rsquo;s Programs - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/about/email_licensing_complaint.cgi">Online  Complaint form</a> or by calling (800)&nbsp;543-7545. </p>
             <h4>How  can I tell if a child care program is operating illegally?
             </h4>
             <p>A child day provider may  have a business license issued by a locality, but <strong>a business license is not the same as a license  issued by the Department of Social Services</strong>.</p>
             <p><u>Child day centers</u> are  child day programs offered to (i) two or more children under the age of 13  years in a facility that is not the residence of the provider or of any of the  children in care or (ii) 13 or more children at any location.  </p>
             <p>Child day centers  must be either<strong> licensed </strong>or<strong> exempt from licensure.</strong> </p>
             <p><strong>A center <u>may</u> be operating illegally if:</strong></p>
             <ul>
               <li>A  current exemption letter cannot be produced; or</li>
               <li>There  are more children in care than are allowed by the license or exemption letter.             </li>
             </ul>
             <p>Ask the center to show you their license or letter of  exemption letter issued by VDSS.  </p>
             <p><strong><u>Licensed  family day homes</u></strong> may provide care for <strong>six to twelve children</strong> (exclusive of the provider's own children  and any children who reside in the home) when at least one child receives care  for compensation. The care may be offered in the home of the provider or in the  home of any of the children in care. </p>
             <p><strong>A family day home <u>may</u> be operating illegally if:</strong></p>
             <ul>
               <li>A  current license cannot be produced; </li>
               <li>The  provider or someone who resides in the home is identified as a sex offender or  child abuser;</li>
               <li>There  are more children in care than are allowed by the license; or</li>
               <li>There  are more than four children under the age of two, including the provider&rsquo;s own  children or any children who reside in the home.             </li>
             </ul>
             <p>Ask the family day home provider to show you their  license issued by VDSS.</p>
             <p><strong><u>Voluntarily  Registered</u></strong><u> <strong>family  day homes</strong></u> are not required to be licensed, but may  choose to be registered. These homes have fewer than six children in care, not  including the provider's own children and any children who reside in the home.  Voluntary registration is not available in areas where local ordinances  regulate unlicensed providers (Arlington, Fairfax, and Alexandria). <br>
              <strong>A voluntarily registered family day home <u>may</u> be operating  illegally if:</strong></p>
             <ul>
               <li>A  current registration certificate cannot be produced; </li>
               <li>The  provider or someone who resides in the home is identified as a child abuser or  is registered as a sex offender; or </li>
               <li>There  are more children in care than are allowed by the registration certificate.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>Ask the family day home provider to show you their  voluntary registration certificate issued by VDSS.</p>
             <p><strong><u>Certified  preschools</u></strong> operated by private schools that are  accredited by a statewide accrediting organization (or another accrediting  organization recognized by the Board of Education) are allowed by <a target="_blank" href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title63.2/chapter17/section63.2-1717/">Section  63.2-1717</a> of the Code of Virginia to be exempt from licensure. In  its request for certification, the preschool must specify whether it meets  subsection B, C or D of that section of the Code of Virginia. </p>
             <p><strong>A certified preschool <u>may</u> be operating illegally if:</strong></p>

		  <h2>Child Care & Early Learning Options          </h2>
		  <p>A child day care  program in Virginia refers to a regularly operating service arrangement for  children where, during the absence of a parent or guardian, a person or  organization has agreed to assume responsibility for the supervision,  protection and well-being of a child under the age of 13 for less than a 24-hour  period. </p>
          <p>There are two  types of child day programs in Virginia: <strong>child day centers</strong> (center-based) and <strong>family day homes</strong> (family-based).</p>
          <p> Categories of  care include:</p>
                  <ul>
				    <li>Licensed</li>
                    <li>Unlicensed (but  regulated) </li>
                    <li>Approved</li>
                    <li>Unlicensed and  Unregistered</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Although, choosing a  licensed provider is strongly encouraged, not all programs require licensure. If  you are unsure about the type of care you are receiving, ask your provider if  they are licensed by the Virginia Department of Social Services (VDSS).  Licensed programs are required to display their license certificate. Look for  this license certificate to be visibly displayed near the entrance. </p>
          <p>Educating yourself on  available care options, and knowing what to look for when selecting a program,  are essential to your child&rsquo;s well-being. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/facility/search/cc.cgi">Search for child day care.</a></p>
                  <p><strong>Licensed</strong><strong> </strong>- When you select a  licensed care provider in Virginia, you are selecting a qualified professional  in the field of early education with a commitment to providing a safe and  healthy environment for children by demonstrating compliance with regulations. Licensed  child day care programs can be offered in a child day center or in a family day  home.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p><strong><em><u>Licensed </u></em></strong>child care programs have initial and  unannounced bi-annual inspections.&nbsp; Additional inspections are made as a  result of violations, allegations and/or complaints. Requirements include  background checks, education, training/orientation, and health and safety  standards. The number of children allowed in licensed care varies per center or  family day home - based on determining factors such as the total square footage in  centers and adequate space in homes. The maximum capacity can be identified on  the provider&rsquo;s posted license certificate. Click the program you are interested  in for further information. </p>

<strong>Unlicensed</strong><strong> (but regulated) -</strong> Some programs offering child day       care obtain a general business license to operate from the county within       which they do business; however, that license is <strong><em><u>not</u></em></strong> the same as a child day care license obtained from the Virginia Department       of Social Services (VDSS), which holds the child day care provider       accountable to the health and safety standards set forth by the       Commonwealth of Virginia.

                    <li><em>Voluntarily       registered family day homes</em> are required to be inspected       prior to certification, and every two years thereafter, to complete       background checks and meet certain health and safety standards.&nbsp; </li>
                    <li><em>Religiously       exempt child&nbsp;care centers</em> are required to complete       background checks and must self-certify annually that the program is in       compliance with background checks and health and safety requirements. </li>
                    <li><em>Certified       preschools</em> are operated by an accredited private school and       are required to complete background checks and must self-certify prior to       certification, and annually thereafter, regarding criminal record       clearances on all employees, a list of staff qualifications, and health       and fire inspection reports.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Religiously exempt child care  centers and certified pre-school programs are not inspected by&nbsp;VDSS unless  there is a complaint. Click the program you are interested in for further  information. </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Less is more!</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Search  using <u>the most distinctive part of the facility&rsquo;s name</u>. For example,  &ldquo;Jonah&rsquo;s Little Whales&rdquo; might have been entered in the database as &ldquo;Jonahs Little  Whales.&rdquo; If the name isn&rsquo;t typed into the search page <u>exactly</u> as it is  spelled in the database, including spaces and punctuation, the search will be  unsuccessful.  Try searching with just  the word Jonah or even Jona, omitting whatever comes after the punctuation. If  there are several facilities with similar names, search for only the part of  the name that is different.</li>
    <li>Try  different spellings: for example, Kids, Kidz, Kids&rsquo;, or Kid&rsquo;s. </li>
    <li>If  the facility&rsquo;s name includes multiple words combined into one, <u>try searching  using only part of the name</u> (for example, Honey instead of HoneyPots). </li>
    <li>If  you entered the name, location and zip code and don&rsquo;t find what you are looking  for, <u>search again using only ONE of those criteria</u>.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The search results will display the  facility&rsquo;s name, address, and phone number. <strong>Click on the facility&rsquo;s/provider&rsquo;s name</strong> to see additional  information, including inspection dates.</li>

  <h2>Paying For Child Care</h2>
  <h4>Need Help Paying For Child Care?</h4>
  <p>The Virginia Department of Social Services  administers the Child Care Subsidy Program which provides financial assistance  to eligible families to help pay a portion of the cost of child care so they  can work or participate in education or training programs. The Child Care  Subsidy Program services are child-centered and family focused and support the  broader objective of strengthening families&rsquo; goals of self-sufficiency and  quality early childhood programs for their children. </p>
  <p><strong>Two ways to apply for The Child Care Subsidy Program &nbsp; </strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CommonHelp</strong> &nbsp;- This web-based app allows Virginians to screen  for eligibility and apply for benefits and services available through  VDSS.&nbsp; This app may be accessed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.&nbsp; To  screen for eligibility and/or apply for subsidy child care assistance via  CommonHelp, click <a target="_blank" href="https://commonhelp.virginia.gov/access/">here</a>.</li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/cc/assistance/parents_guardians/forms/032-02-0109-07-eng.pdf">Child Care Service  Application and Redetermination Form</a> - This  form may be completed manually and returned to your <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/localagency/index.html">local department of social services.</a> You may pick up an application in the office, or request that one be  mailed to you. </li>
  </ul>

    <div> </div>
  </div>
<h4>How the Child Care Subsidy Program Works</h4>
      <p>The Child Care Subsidy Program helps low  income families pay their child care fees so they can work or participate in  education or training programs. You may screen for your potential eligibility  and/or apply for assistance online at: <a target="_blank" href="https://commonhelp.virginia.gov/access/">https://commonhelp.virginia.gov/access/</a>. Your application will be reviewed within 30  days.&nbsp;During that time, you may be required to participate in an interview  and provide verification of income, employment and/or participation in an  education or training program, in addition to other required documents.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>If you are eligible, and are approved for  services, your local department will authorize care for your children with a  VDSS Subsidy-approved child care provider of your choice, and VDSS will pay a  part of the child care cost directly to your provider. This is called a subsidy  payment. You may also be required to pay a part of the cost; this is called the  family co-pay. The subsidy payment and the family co-pay go directly to your  chosen child care provider.</p>
       <p> If your child care subsidy does not pay the  full amount that your child care provider charges, you may be required  to  pay the difference between the subsidy payment and their private charges.</p>
       <p> Licensed child care providers are paid by  the Subsidy Program at a rate higher than the rate paid to unlicensed  providers.  This difference generally  reflects the higher level health and safety requirements with which the  licensed providers must comply.  </p>
<h4>Approved for a subsidy… Now What?</h4> 
  <p>When you  are approved for child care assistance, you will play an important part in this  process. Your case manager will discuss all of your responsibilities with you. </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><em><strong>Choose a provider and inform your case manager</strong></em><br>
      Once you have selected the provider that best meets your needs and the       needs of your child/children, please contact your case manager so care can       be authorized.</li>
  </ul>
  <em><strong>Participate in the Virginia  Electronic Child Care System</strong></em><br>
When you begin using your child care services, you will be required to  participate in the Electronic Child Care (ECC) System.&nbsp;You will receive an  ECC Card in the mail which must be activated, and must be used to record  attendance for your child/children. <strong>You  will be expected to record attendance daily</strong> with your chosen child care provider  to ensure accurate and timely payment for services. To learn more about the  Virginia Electronic Child Care System, view the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/cc/assistance/providers/guidance_procedures/parent_posdevice_qrc42013.pdf">Quick  Reference Guide</a> or watch the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC0419u76jM">video</a>.

<h2>Child Growth &amp; Development</h2>
<p>From  birth to age 5 is an incredibly exciting time of growth and development. It is  during these early years when children develop the foundations for social,  emotional, physical, language and cognitive growth. During these years, you may  also have many questions about your child&rsquo;s development.</p>
  <h4>How do I know if my child is  developing typically?</h4>
    <p>Children  develop in similar patterns at similar times, and typically go through a  sequence of accomplishments (crawl, stand, walk, run.) However, each child is  unique and will therefore learn, grow and reach milestones according to  their own timeline. Knowing when to be concerned and when not to be is  important for parents and family members. Your child&rsquo;s pediatrician is your  partner in determining whether or not your child is developing typically. The  Center for Disease Control has a wealth of information about child development  and developmental milestones. To learn more, or to see how your child is  progressing, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/milestones/index.html">click here</a>. <strong></strong>
    </p>
  
    <h4><em>Milestones of Child Development </em></h4>
    <p>Virginia&rsquo;s  Milestones of Child Development is a comprehensive resource for family members  and providers who care for young children. They focus on the observable  behaviors that highlight the learning and development that occurs from birth to  kindergarten, as well as recommended strategies to provide optimal learning  environments and experiences. The Milestones are organized into 6 areas of  children&rsquo;s growth that encompass the dimensions of children&rsquo;s overall  development:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Social  and emotional development</li>
  <li>Approaches  to learning</li>
  <li>Language  and literacy</li>
  <li>Cognition  and general knowledge</li>
  <li>Fine  arts, and</li>
  <li>Physical  development and health</li>
</ul>
<p>All  of these areas of development are interrelated, and growth in one area often  influences or depends on development in other areas. No area is more important  than another. To learn more about Virginia&rsquo;s Milestones, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/cc/provider_training_development/intro_page/publications/milestones/milestones_one_document/Milestones_Revised.pdf">click here</a>.</p>
<h4>Who do I contact to have my child screened?</h4>
<p>If  you have concerns about your baby, and would like to request a developmental  screening, you can contact the Infant &amp; Toddler Connection of Virginia at  1-800-234-1448.</p>
<h4>Early Intervention in Virginia</h4>
<p>Early  intervention services are  services provided through the Individuals  with Disabilities Act (IDEA) that are designed to meet the developmental needs  of each child and their family, and provided in natural environments for the  child (such as the home or child care setting.) Services are offered through  two distinct programs: Part B (preschool  children ages 3-5) and Part C (infants  and toddlers ages 0-2). To learn more about Early Intervention in Virginia, click <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-M_P6HrZdA&list=UUDNrV5XsIRCWWN9n7FqGfpA">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Early intervention for Infants and  Toddlers (Part C of IDEA)
</h4>
<p>From  birth through age 2 a child is eligible to receive services if they:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have delayed  functioning</li>
  <li>Exhibit  atypical development or behavior</li>
  <li>Demonstrate  a behavioral disorder that interferes with development, or</li>
  <li>Have  a diagnosed physical or mental condition with a high probability of a resulting  delay (even if no delay currently exists)</li>
</ul>
<p>Early  intervention services are provided by the Infant &amp; Toddler Connection of  Virginia. To learn more, determine if your child is eligible, or find your  local program, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.infantva.org/">click here</a>.</p>
<h4>Early Intervention for Preschool (Part  B of IDEA) </h4>
<p>Preschoolers may be  eligible to receive early intervention services through the  Early Childhood Special Education program of  the Virginia Department of Education if they have one or more of 14 disability  categories such as, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Autism  spectrum disorders</li>
  <li>Learning  or emotional disability</li>
  <li>Visual,  hearing or speech impairment</li>
  <li>Developmental  delay</li>
</ul>
<p>Early  intervention services for preschool aged children are provided by local school  districts. To learn more about early intervention for preschool children,  determine if your child is eligible, or find more information on the 14  disability categories, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.doe.virginia.gov/special_ed/early_childhood/index.shtml">click here</a>.</p>
<h4>Your rights under IDEA </h4>
<p>The  Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) is a federal law that ensures children  with disabilities receive services such as early intervention, special  education, and related programs. Under this law, parents have specific special  education rights, which are detailed in Virginia&rsquo;s Procedural Safeguards  Notice. To learn more, click <a target="_blank" href="http://doe.virginia.gov/special_ed/regulations/state/procedural_safeguards/english_procedural_safeguards.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Early Childhood Mental Health </h4>
<p>Early  childhood is a critical time for developing the foundations for later emotional  and mental wellness. Adverse experiences have the potential to affect brain  development, and contribute to developmental delays. The foundations for strong  mental health include a safe environment, adequate nutrition, and positive  interactions with caregivers. Mental health is part of overall health; a  healthy child has a healthy body and a healthy mind. To learn more about mental  wellness in early childhood click <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ecmhva.org/">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Home Visiting </h4>
<p>The  Virginia Home Visiting Consortium is a group of public and non-profit programs  that serve families of children from pregnancy through age 5. Their purpose is  to deliver in-home parenting education and family support services that improve  the health, social and educational outcomes of young children and their  families.

 <p>The Safe to Sleep® campaign  (formerly known as Back to Sleep®) aims to educate parents, caregivers, and  health care providers about ways to reduce the risk of SIDS and other  sleep-related causes of infant death.    About 3,500 babies die suddenly and unexpectedly each year in the United  States.  These deaths are the result of  unknown causes, Accidental Suffocation and Strangulation in Bed (ASSB), and  Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is defined as an unidentified cause  of death in a baby younger than one year.   Here you will find additional information about SIDS to arm yourself  with the information to keep your children safe at home and with their child  care provider.  For additional  information please click <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/sts/Pages/default.aspx">here</a>.</p>

 <h4>Shaken Baby Syndrome</h4>
 <p> Shaken baby syndrome is a type of inflicted traumatic  brain injury that happens when a baby is violently shaken.&nbsp; A baby has  weak neck muscles and a large, heavy head.&nbsp; Shaking makes the fragile  brain bounce back and forth inside the skull and causes bruising, swelling, and  bleeding, which can lead to permanent, severe brain damage or death.  Shaken baby injuries usually occur in  children younger than 2 years old, but may be seen in children up to the age of  5.  To learn more about Shaken Baby  Syndrome as well as tips for parents and providers to understand the triggers  and reduce the occurrence of injury click <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childmaltreatment/abusive-head-trauma.html">here</a>.</p>

<h4>How can you tell if a child care  program is operating illegally?</h4>
<ul>
      <li>A  child day provider may have a business license issued by a locality, but <strong>a business license is not the same as a  license issued by the Department of Social Services</strong>.</li>
      <li><u>Child  day centers</u> are child day  programs offered to (i) two or more children under the age of 13 years in a  facility that is not the residence of the provider or of any of the children in  care or (ii) 13 or more children at any location.  </li>
      <li>Child  day centers must be either<strong> licensed </strong>or<strong> exempt from licensure.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>A center <u>may</u> be operating  illegally if:</h4>
<ul>
      <li>A  current license or exemption letter cannot be produced; or</li>
      <li>There  are more children in care than are allowed by the license or exemption letter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask  the center to show you their license or letter of exemption issued by  VDSS. <br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>Licensed family day homes</u></strong> may  provide care for <strong>six to twelve children</strong> (exclusive of the provider's own children and any children who reside in the  home) when at least one child receives care for compensation. The care may be  offered in the home of the provider or in the home of any of the children in  care. </p>
<h4>A family day home <u>may</u> be  operating illegally if:</h4>
<ul>
      <li>A  current license cannot be produced; </li>
      <li>The  provider or someone who resides in the home is identified as a sex offender or  child abuser;</li>
      <li>There  are more children in care than are allowed by the license; or</li>
      <li>There  are more than four children under the age of two, including the provider&rsquo;s own  children or any children who reside in the home.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ask  the family day home provider to show you their license issued by VDSS.</p>
<ul>
     <li><strong><u>Voluntarily Registered</u></strong><u> <strong>family  day homes</strong></u> are not required  to be licensed, but may choose to be registered. These homes have fewer than  six children in care, not including the provider's own children and any  children who reside in the home. Voluntary registration is not available in  areas where local ordinances regulate unlicensed providers (Arlington, Fairfax,  and Alexandria). </li>
      </ul>

<h4>A voluntarily registered family day  home <u>may</u> be operating illegally if:</h4>
<ul>
      <li>A  current registration letter cannot be produced; </li>
      <li>The  provider or someone who resides in the home is identified as a child abuser or  is registered as a sex offender; or </li>
      <li>There  are more children in care than are allowed by the registration letter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask the  family day home provider to show you their voluntary registration letter issued  by VDSS.</p>
<ul>
      <li><strong><u>Certified preschools </u></strong>operated by private  schools that are accredited by a statewide accrediting organization (or another  accrediting organization recognized by the Board of Education) are allowed by <a target="_blank" href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title63.2/chapter17/section63.2-1717/">Section  63.2-1717</a> of the Code of  Virginia to be exempt from licensure. In its request for certification, the  preschool must specify whether it meets subsection B, C or D of that section of  the Code of Virginia. </li>
</ul>
<h4>A certified preschool <u>may</u> be  operating illegally if:</h4>
<ul>
      <li>A  current certificate cannot be produced; or</li>
      <li>The  program does not meet the requirements in the Code of Virginia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask the preschool to show you their certificate issued by VDSS.</p>-->
