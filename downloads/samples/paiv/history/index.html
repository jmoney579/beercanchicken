					  <h1>History</h1>
						<p>PAIV was  founded on October 3, 1990 by a local agency Fraud Investigator as a grass  roots attempt to improve the state&rsquo;s program integrity efforts and to increase  the professionalism of Virginian&rsquo;s investigative staff. A small group of investigators  met in Richmond to unite the Regional Fraud Committees into a statewide group  for the purpose of making the State Department of Social Services, the local  agencies, the legislature, and the public aware of the problem of welfare  fraud.</p>
                    <p>In the ensuing years, PAIV has  worked diligently to put the fraud control function in the proper perspective  and to integrate that function into the overall operation of DSS. We have  always held as our mandate that controlling welfare fraud is an issue of program  integrity and as such, should be treated as a departmental goal and function.  In 1998, PAIV successfully petitioned the VA General Assembly to make fraud  investigation a mandated program and the State Board of Social Services was  charged with the responsibility of designing the operational guidelines to  accomplish that purpose. DSS, under the insightful leadership of Commissioner  Clarence Carter, responded by establishing a Office of the Inspector General,  by significantly increasing the Central Office fraud staff and expanding their  function, and by contracting with VISSTA to provide much needed training  opportunities for new and existing fraud investigative staff.<br>
