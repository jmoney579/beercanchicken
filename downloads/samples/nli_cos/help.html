<h2><a name="about">About CAS</a></h2>
<p>The Virginia Tech Central Authentication Service, CAS, is a
<a indepth="true" href="single_sign_on.html">single sign-on</a>
service that provides access to many secure VT Web sites and external sites that
use <a href="http://www.middleware.vt.edu/doku.php?id=middleware:shib">Shibboleth</a>.
</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.middleware.vt.edu/doku.php?id=middleware:cas">CAS wiki</a>
provides policy and technical information for integrating VT applications with CAS.</p>

<h2><a name="features">CAS Features</a></h2>
<h3>Warn</h3>
<p>The <em>warn</em> checkbox on the login form provides additional information about
a service that requests secure access via CAS.  If the <em>warn</em> checkbox
is selected, a screen like the following is displayed when a user attempts to
access a CAS-enabled service.</p>

<h3>PDC Login</h3>
<p>CAS supports authentication via an SSL (X.509) client certificate issued by
the Virginia Tech User CA, which is commonly referred to as a Personal Digial
Certificate (PDC). PDC login is more secure than standard username password
login for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Certificates are more resistant to theft.</li>
<li>Certificates are much more resistant to brute force attacks (analogous to
password guessing).</li>
</ol>
<p>At the present time, the only method of distributing PDCs is via the Aladdin eToken USB fob.</p>

<h3>Single Sign-Out</h3>
<p>When you end your CAS single sign-on session by logging out of CAS, CAS attempts to
log you out of all the services that you visited during your session.  While this
works well under normal circumstances, there are a number of fundamental limitations
with this feature.  For that reason it is strongly recommended that you
<strong>close your browser</strong> after logging out of CAS, particularly in
cases where additional security is merited, such as a shared computer.</p>

<h2><a name="incommon">InCommon Assurance</a></h2>
<p>Virginia Tech is certified to assert InCommon Bronze and Silver qualifiers for PDC users
  who need to access federated services requiring higher levels of trust according to the
  <a indepth="true" href="default_013.html">InCommon Assurance Program</a>.
  All CAS single sign-on sessions started with PDC authentication will convey these qualifiers
  to federated services via the Virginia Tech Shibboleth IdP.
