<h2>Welcome to Portfolio v3.0!</h2>
<p>Feeling nostalgic? Come and take a ride in the <a href="index_old.html">time traveler</a>.</p>
<h2>A little about me</h2>
<p>I'm currently working for a major university in Virginia leading the design of multiple applications supporting my home department's mission and goals. I also oversee the instruction of courses related to web design/development, graphics design, and training of the university's content management system.  My final primary responsibility is to provide web communications assistance for the university community.</p>

<p>I've always been fascinated with creativity and design, welcoming any chance to explore new concepts and bring them to life.</p>

<p>If you're in need of someone to help you take an idea and make it reality, I'd love to <a class="norm_nav" href="#home_3">hear from you.</a><a class="mobile_nav" href="#ct" title="Responsive Contact">hear from you.</a></p>

<h3>About this site</h3>
<p>This site is not only a showcase of the work that I've done in the past, but also my little test bed of what can be done. In order to keep the web fresh, you have to use the most up to date technology.  CSS3 and HTML5 are the new hot trends in web development; this site is built with those as the foundation.  This notion of using the most recent and up-to-date technology is something that I take to heart.  If you have a project that needs revamping or created from scratch, you can be assured that it will be created as a work that will stand the test of time.</p>

        <h3>NLI Computer Ordering and Enrollment System</h3>
        <h4>Computer Ordering System</h4>
		<p>The NLI computer Ordering system was built to help facilitate the computer refresh program.  In this program, eligible faculty must complete a certain number of courses to recieve a new computer.  The computer ordering system serves as an essential piece to the program.  I led the design of the system and assisted with its implementation.  Using Photoshop, Django, HTML5, CSS, and Javascript, I created the mockups and developed the template.  Since much of the system requires credentals to access, I've created a mock version of the site for exploration.  The database functionality is not present; however, all other aspects of the design can be seen.</p>

  		<h4 class="nowrap second">Enrollment System</h4>
		<p class="nowrap">Networked Learning Initiatives is a program derived by Pillar 6 of the University's strategic plan, concerning educational opportunities for personnel, in the Virginia Tech Information Technology Strategic Plan. This enrollment system was designed to facilitate developmental opportunities for faculty and staff.  I was tasked with the design and usuability testing of the system.  Leveraging Python, Django and CSS3, myself and another developed the system. Our primary concern was to make a system which was flexible, extensive and expandable, many facets that the previous system was unable to accomplish. </p>

        <h3>Massey Cancer Center</h3>
		<p>This mockup and its corresponding site were created as an assignment for the Massey Cancer Center.  I was tasked with styling the linked page without modifying any of the HTML of the page.  I found this assignment very provocative to the extent that I've chosen to showcase the site and their <a href="downloads/mcc/MCC_Enhancement_Proposal.pdf">site improvement proposal</a>.  The task itself, though relatively simple from an outside point-of-view, is actually a complex issue that many web designers face on an everyday basis.  Content Management Systems have become the primary solution for large entities to manage their web presence.
		However, they can be very inflexible when it comes to the HTML output they produce.  This project was the perfect illustration of how web designers overcome these challenges.</p>

		<h3>Portfolio 2.0</h3>
		<p>I created this website approximately 2 years ago.  Since the typical half-life for a website is anywhere between a year and three, I felt that it was due for retirement.  My intentions with this site were to be bold and carry an "in your face" style.  It worked well, but the world has moved towards more minimalistic designs.</p>
		<p>You also noticed that version 2.0 is showcased, but a 1.0 is not.  Version 1.0, though complete in design, was never complete in content or saw the light of day.  However, if you're really curious you might find it lurking around here somewhere<a  href="archive/index.html" title="Version 1.0 Portfolio" target="_blank">.</a></p>

        <h3>Networked Learning Initiatives (NLI)</h3>
		<p>Networked Learning Initiatives was formed as the next generation of the formally known department, Faculty Development Institute. It's mission is to bring multiple disciplines of the university together to create developmental opportunities for faculty, staff and graduate students at Virginia Tech.</p><br/>
		<h4>Wordpress Powered Site</h4>
		<p>In conjunction with the formation of this new department, a new web presence was needed.  Using the power of Wordpress, a well known content management system, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alisujinkim.com/">Alison Kim</a> and I developed this site.  I can't take credit for the initial design as we started with Themify's theme Grido.  From there, we modified it to fit the needs of the department.</p>

	<h4 class="nowrap second">Percussion CM System Site</h4>
	<p class="nowrap">Although replaced by the Wordpress driven site above, the Networked Learning Initiatives website was initally created in the Percussion Rhythmyx CM system provided by the university.  The department requested a unique look for their site which stood out from the standard university branded templates.  My task was to research and develop a template which addressed those requests. I was able to secure a template which was slated for production but was never implemented.  However, the theme was incomplete.  I modified and completed the missing aspects of the design while also changing them slighty to create a unique visual presentation.  The images below display the completed site along with a screenshot of the original template from which I created the new design.</p>

	<p>The Electronic Geological Management System(EGEMS) is a software package developed by ECLIPSE. This is ECLIPSE services' first production system eligible for institutional and private consumer purchase. I was hired to redesign their current site and develop a more professional appearance. This site incorporates multiple PHP based forms for contact and software purchases made by consumers. Using paypal's linklok system, we (my client and I) developed a secure purchasing site for product sales.</p><br/>
	<strong>Update:</strong>EGEMS has become a creative commons application and the owner can no support marketing of the product.  The site has been retired; however, you can still views its design and functionality through the sample site below.

	<h3>Human Resources Forms Library</h3>
	<p>The Human Resources Forms Library was created to serve as a central repository of all the forms needed to perform the HR functions required by internally and externally consumers of the department. This Library was coded in php and javascript utilizing a MySQL database on the backend of the application. Using the library, those external to the department can easily search and locate forms needed for HR required operations. For those internal to Human Resources, the system allows for uploads of new forms and modifications of current forms. In addition to management functions, the system also records the use of downloaded forms for record keeping and statistical analysis.</p>

<p>The mockups showcased below were instrumental in the creation of each of their respective sites.  In every web development project that I've led, I began the process by creating mockups of the intended design.  Once finalized, it's much easier to turn dream into reality. </p>

<h4>Innovator in Learning Grant Interviews</h4>
<p>These short clips were developed to showcase the concepts and inspirations of the individuals who recieved the Innovator in Learning Grant Awards. A team was selected to develop these in the most efficient manner.  Myself and another, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alisujinkim.com/">Alison Kim</a>, produced the videos and led their creation.  We relied on the skills of another one of our graduate students, Tamar Petersen, to edit and post the videos. The end result can be seen in the videos below:</p>

<h4 class="nowrap">Togersen 3080 Promotional Video</h4>
							<p>The video below was a random spur of the moment idea that developed as we were experimenting with room setups.  To give you a brief overview, one of the classrooms we used for educational opportunities was remodeled using furniture from <a id="link" href="http://hermanmiller.com"> Herman Miller</a>.  Dubbed "Room 20" it serves as an experimental classroom with rearrangeble furniture and a myriad of technology.
							Using the departmental graduate assistants, we shot this video to engage potential users of the room and give them a brief snippet of the arrangements that they could do.</p>

	<h3>Web Development</h3>
	<p>This course is essentially a redesign of the Dreamweaver CS5+ course series. However, in this series the focus of the course is directed towards the coding of websites and not the application for doing so.  I chose to pursue a course of this nature to move away from the dependency of Dreamweaver.  There are many applications used for web development and I feel that the choice should be made by the individual instead of the instructor.</p>
	<p>By using a flipped classroom approach, I was able to eliminate a session from its initial iteration as the Dreamweaver CS5 course which required three for a complete understanding of the topic.  Prior to the first session, participants were asked to view a series of tutorials from <a href="http://lynda.com">lynda.com</a>.  I then referenced many of the topics in those tutorials during the inital session to serve as a review for the participants.  This allowed me to forgo providing direct instruction in HTML and move directly to CSS principles.<p>
	<p>The overall goal of the course suite is to develop a responsive website using HTML5 and CSS3.  During the sessions, we explore CSS code structure, proper usage cases and advanced topics through a sseries of hands-on exercises.  Animation, media queries and content transformation are also included in the course.</p>

	<h3>Web Design</h3>
	<p>Web design can be a tricky concept to teach and this course was no exception to the rule.  I struggled in figuring out the concepts and a way to teach those concepts to a large group.  In the end, I was able to develop two courses which accurately expressed current web design principles. 
	These two courses centered around the visual presentation of the site and the content structure of the site.</p>  
	<p>In the visual presentation course, I leverage collaboration as the biggest tool in web design.  Anyone who has ever done any design work knows that its never a singular task.  
	At the very least, they ask a friend "what do you think of this?" or "does this make sense?".  In this course, I first run them through some stable concepts used in web design and then I have them form groups and evaluate a site using the tools that I provided.  They're asked to identify
	positive and negative design elements of the sites they evaluated and then present these to the classroom for discussion.  This is the crutch of the course.  The ultimate objective is that they leave with the necessary tools, applied principles, and friends they can bounce ideas off of later.</p>
	<p>The content structure course focuses instruction on proper ways to setup your folder structure and determine what should be retained on an existing site or what to include on a new site.  As in the previous course, collaboration is a key element.  I first begin the course with information about development processes currently in use.  
	We then proceed to an exercise in determining who the key stakeholders that the site will attract and what items they will want at close reach.  Using this information, we're able to determine the site navigation which, in turn, defines the folder structure.  Leaving the course, they should take away the development processes and tools needed to structure their sites.</p>

<h3>Adobe Dreamweaver CS5+</h3>
<p>Over the past two years, many iterations of this course have been taught.  I intitally started three individual sessions of the course under a pedagogical approach.  As time continued and the nature of education grew, the course was modified to fit the needs of the faculty and staff.  The current course is being taught through a flipped classroom aproach.  Attendants are asked to complete a set of tutorials prior to the in-class session.  This allows me to focus on the indiviual needs of those in the course as well as the overall class itself.</p>
					<p>Because of the complex nature of the software and the challenges of web development, I've broken the course up into three sessions in its inital state.  The first course focused primary on HTML coding.  The simple syntax as well as text and image modifications.  In a nutshell, this course was designed for those who would simply be editing a website.  The second and third courses are centered around an understanding of CSS and page structure.  In these two courses, I guide the attendants through the skills necessary to produce websites from scratch and provide them with the tools to succeed in the web development realm.</p>

<h3>Adobe Photoshop CS5+</h3>
<p>Photoshop is probably one of the most extensive and well know applications by Adobe, next to Illustrator.  Each of these classes typically have high enrollment and an unobtainable expectation to learn everything about the software in the mere two hours time-slot of the section.</p>
<p>After many iteration and failures, I finally developed a solution that satisfied all.  It's still not the full gamut of the software but provides a good overview and the necessary resources for someone that's interested in learning and exploring more of what the software can do.</p>
<p>To start, we go over the basic interface and tools that are available for use.  I include a handout that describes each tool and its functions, which is linked below.  We then move into simple resizing and cropping before starting the more complex things.  The content-aware tool, clone stamp and image mask function are a few of the tools covered in the later portion of the course.  I end the course with information about the different file formats and when they should be used per project type.</p>

<h3>Percussion CM System</h3>
<p>Percussion Rhythmyx CM System is the content management system currently used by the university; we have branded it as Ensemble.  For these courses, I have a wide variety of participants.  Some have a background in webdesign, others have never touched a site but the beauty of a content management system is that you don't need to understand how to code to build a site.  There are four sessions of the course ranging in levels of difficulty.  The first course is a simple introduction to the system.  We build a page, edit text and insert images and links.  The second course takes things a set further by introducing how to include multimedia and relationship items.  There is also a navigation course about putting the entire site together from the homepage to the tying of items together via navigation. The final course is the most complex.  In this course, we dive into the use of CSS with the system to create a unique web presence that differs from the standard templates developed by the University.</p>
