		  <h2 id="quality">Why Quality Matters</h2>
			<p>All  parents want to support their child&rsquo;s health, happiness and development.  Choosing quality child care is an excellent way to do this! A quality child  care program promotes a safe, fun environment where children can PLAY, LEARN  and LAUGH! </p>
            <p><strong>A Safe and Quality Program will:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Have  qualified, trained and experienced staff</li>
              <li>Impact  how children learn, think, develop and behave</li>
              <li>Promote  social and emotional skills</li>
              <li>Encourage  curiosity and cultivates a love of learning</li>
              <li>Prepare  children for school </li>
              <li>Ensure an organized, clean and safe  environment (inside and out)</li>
              <li>Provide proper adult-to-child ratios ensuring  appropriate supervision</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Adhere  to state regulations and guidelines<strong></strong><br>
              <strong>Indicators  of Quality Child Care (can  make info below a two column chart)</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Relationships and Interactions</strong>
                          <p>Skillful adults provide warm, responsive relationships that foster  confidence as they respond to children&rsquo;s needs consistently. Adults engage in  culturally and linguistically appropriate conversations with the children, and  are respectful and supportive of each child and their family.</p>
                          </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Staff Qualifications and Training</strong>
                          <p>Knowledgeable adults structure the environment to provide maximum  opportunities for children to learn.   Teachers who are better prepared are more likely to engage in positive  interactions, plan developmentally appropriate activities, and use feedback to  develop strong relationships.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Play and Learning:</strong>
                          <p>The curriculum is age appropriate,  supported by a variety of toys and materials, and promotes learning and  development in all areas. There is a written plan that outlines the educational  goals, activities, materials, assessment, and daily schedule.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Health and Safety</strong>
                          <p>A safe child care program puts health and safety first. The  environment is organized, clean and safe (inside and out), toys and equipment  are monitored and cleaned daily, and safe health practices, such as hand washing,  are consistently followed. This program will also promote nutrition and  exercise to support healthy development.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Low Ratios and Group Size</strong>
                          <p>The number of children a staff member is responsible for can be  described as a ratio. A 3:1 ratio means there are 3 children per caregiver.  Group size refers to the total number of children per class, program or home.  Generally speaking the fewer the children in relation to caregivers the greater  the supervision. </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

		  <h2 id="childcare">Child Care & Early Learning Options</h2>
				  <p><a href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/cc/guidance_parents/choosing_qcc/Eng_-_choosing-quality-childcare_brochure_small.pdf">Choosing  child care</a> is one of the most important decisions you will ever make as a  parent. There are several types of child care programs to choose from to ensure  you are receiving the highest quality care for your child.  Although, choosing a licensed provider is  strongly is encouraged, not all programs require licensure. Educating yourself  on available care options and knowing what to look for when selecting a program  is essential to your child&rsquo;s well-being. </p>
                  <p><strong>The  3 types of child care: </strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Licensed </strong>- When you select a licensed care provider in  Virginia, you are selecting a qualified professional in the field of early  education with a commitment to providing a safe and healthy environment for  children by demonstrating compliance with regulations. Licensed child day care programs:</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Can  be offered in a center or in a residential home.  </li>
                      <li>Are  subject to initial and unannounced annual inspections.  Additional inspections are conducted as a  result of violations and/or complaints. </li>
                      <li>Have requirements for background checks, education,  training/orientation, and health and safety standards. </li>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Unlicensed -</strong> Some programs offering child day  care obtain a general business license to operate from the county within which  they do business; however, that license is <strong><em><u>not</u></em></strong> the same as a child day  care license obtained from the Virginia Department of Social Services (VDSS),  which holds the child day care provider accountable to the health and safety  standards set forth by the Commonwealth of Virginia.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unlicensed  and Unregistered</strong>  child day care programs <strong><em><u>do not</u></em></strong> have  any of the following requirements or safeguards to protect vulnerable children:  background checks, training/orientation, or health and safety requirements; and  only minimal Code of Virginia requirements apply. </li>
                    <li>Unlicensed and  unregistered centers must meet an exemption in the Code of Virginia in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1715/">63.2-1715</a>.   For example, this program may be an after  school program centered around a particular extra-curricular or sports related  activity. </li>
                    <li>Unlicensed and unregistered family day  homes typically known as your family, friend or neighbor provide care in their  home or the home of the child. <strong>The  Virginia Department of Social Services <em><u>does  not</u></em> inspect these programs for any reason and often times these  programs are unknown to the Department.</strong><u> </u></li>
                    <li>Unlicensed and unregistered family day  homes must follow the Code of Virginia requirements in §§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title63.2/chapter17/section63.2-1727/">63.2-1727</a>, which prohibits the caregiver from  being a sex offender or child abuser and <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1704.1/">63.2-1704.1</a> , which requires the caregiver to  provide in writing a notice to the parent stating that their child care program  is not regulated by the Department and to refer parents to the Department&rsquo;s  website for information explaining the various types of child care  options.  <em>If you suspect that a child day care program is operating  illegally, you can file an </em><a href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/about/email_licensing_complaint.cgi"><em>Online Complaint form</em></a><em> or call (800)&nbsp;543-7545.</em><em><u> </u></em></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>A child day care  program in Virginia refers to a regularly operating service arrangement for  children where, during the absence of a parent or guardian, a person or  organization has agreed to assume responsibility for the supervision,  protection and well-being of a child under the age of 13 for less than a 24-hour  period. </p>
          <p>There are two  types of child day programs in Virginia: <strong>non-residential  care</strong> (center-based) and <strong>residential  care</strong> (family-based). </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Categories of  care include: <br>
                      Licensed</li>
                    <li>Unlicensed (but  regulated) </li>
                    <li>Approved</li>
                    <li>Unlicensed and  Unregistered</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Not all child care  programs in Virginia are required to be licensed. If you are unsure about the  type of care you are receiving, ask your provider if they are licensed by the  Virginia Department of Social Services (VDSS). Licensed programs are required  to display their license certificate. Look for this license certificate to be visibly displayed  near the entrance. <a href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/facility/search/cc.cgi">Search for  child day care</a>. </p>
                  <p><strong><em><u>Licensed </u></em></strong>child care programs have  initial and unannounced annual inspections.   Additional inspections are made as a result of violations, allegations  and/or complaints. Requirements include background checks, education,  training/orientation, and health and safety standards. The number of children  allowed in licensed care varies per center or family-based on determining  factors such as the total square footage in centers and adequate space in  homes. The maximum capacity can be identified on the provider&rsquo;s posted license  certificate. Click the program you are interested in for further information. </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><em>Voluntarily registered family day homes</em> are required to be inspected prior to  certification, and every two years thereafter, to complete background checks  and meet certain health and safety standards.&nbsp; </li>
                    <li><em>Religiously exempt child   care centers</em> are required to complete background checks  and must self-certify annually that the program is in compliance with  background checks and health and safety requirements. </li>
                    <li><em>Certified preschools</em> are operated by an accredited private school  and are required to complete background checks and must self-certify prior to  certification, and annually thereafter, regarding criminal  record clearances on all employees, a list of staff qualifications, and health and fire inspection  reports.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Religiously exempt child  care centers and certified pre-school programs  are not inspected by  VDSS unless there  is a complaint. Click the program you are interested in for further information. </p>

<h4>Need help paying for child care?</h4>
  The  Child Care Subsidy Program helps low-income parents pay for child care while  they work or participate in approved education or training programs.  In addition to the Subsidy Program, the  Commonwealth of Virginia offers numerous other programs to assist low-income  families in their goal of achieving economic self-sufficiency and securing quality  early childhood programs for their children.  <br>
  The <em>Family Resource Reference Guide</em> offers families a brief overview of available programs and steps to apply.   <a href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/cc/guidance_parents/additional_resources/CCS-FamilyResourceGuide.pdf">Click here</a> to view the brochure or hyper link Family Resource Reference  Guide.:
<p>There  are two ways to apply for The Child Care Subsidy Program:  </p>
<p><strong>CommonHelp</strong>  - a web based app that allows Virginians to  screen for eligibility, and apply for benefits and services available through  VDSS.  This app may be accessed 24 hours  a day, 7 days a week.  <br>
  <strong>Child  Care Service Application and Redetermination Form</strong> this form  may be completed manually and returned to your local department of social services (hyperlink to local  offices on public).  You may pick  up an application in the office, or request that one be mailed to you.</p>
<h4>How the Child Care Subsidy Program Works</h4>
  The  Child Care Subsidy Program helps low income families pay their child care  fees.  The state and federal governments  fund this program, which is managed by your local department of social  services.  To be considered, an  application for services must be submitted to determine if a family is  eligible.  Your services application will  be reviewed within 30 days.  During that  time, you will be required to participate in an intake interview and provide  verification of income, employment and/or participation in an education or  training program, in addition to other required documents.  
<p>To  receive subsidy assistance, you must have a child or children who need care  while you are at work or attend an education program.  Your eligibility will be determined based on  your family&rsquo;s gross monthly household income.   Income guidelines vary based on where you live across the state and the  size of your family.  If you are  determined to be eligible, and are approved for services, your local department  will authorize care for your children with a VDSS Subsidy approved child care  vendor of your choice and VDSS will pay a part of the child care cost based on  the age of your child and the rates that are determined by VDSS.  This is called a subsidy payment.  You may also be required to pay a part of the  cost; this is called the family co-pay.  The  subsidy payment and the family co-pay go directly to your chosen child care  vendor.</p>
<p>If  your child care subsidy does not pay the full amount that your child care  vendor charges, the vendor may require you to pay the difference between the  subsidy payment and their private charges.</p>
<h4>Approved for a subsidy… Now What?</h4> 
  When  you are approved for child care assistance, you will play an important part in  this process.  Your case manager will  discuss all of your responsibilities with you.
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Choose  a vendor and inform your case manager</em></strong><br/>
  Once  you have selected the vendor that best meets your needs and the needs of your  child/children, please contact your case manager so care can be authorized.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Participate  in the Virginia Electronic Child Care System</em></strong><br/>
  When you  begin using your child care services, you will be required to participate in  the Electronic Child Care (ECC) System.   You will receive an ECC Card in the mail which must be activated, and  must be used to record attendance for your child/children.  You will be expected to record attendance  daily with your chosen child care vendor to ensure accurate and timely payment  for services.<br>

<h2 id="growth">Child Growth &amp; Development</h2>
<p>Research  tells us that 90% of brain development occurs in the first five years of life,  and what children experience in these early years (see, hear, smell, taste and  feel) shapes their brain. High quality child care programs feature enriched  experiences that are linked to greater achievement and success in school and in  life.</p>
<p>From  birth to age 5 is an incredibly exciting time of growth and development. It is  during these early years when children develop the foundations for social,  emotional, physical, language and cognitive growth.</p>
  <h4>How do I know if my child is  developing typically?</h4>
    <p>Children  develop in similar patterns at similar times, and typically go through a  sequence of accomplishments (crawl, stand, walk, run.) However, each child is  unique and will therefore learn and grow and reach milestones according to  their own timeline. Knowing when to be concerned and when not to be is  important for parents and family members. Your child&rsquo;s pediatrician is your  partner in determining whether or not your child is developing typically. The  Center for Disease Control has a wealth of information about child development  and developmental milestones. To learn more, or to see how your child is  progressing, click <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/milestones/index.html">here</a>. <strong></strong>
    </p>
  
    <h4>Milestones of Child Development </h4>
    <p>Virginia&rsquo;s  Milestones of Child Development is a comprehensive resource for family members  and providers who care for young children. They focus on the observable  behaviors that highlight the learning and development that occurs from birth to  kindergarten, as well as recommended strategies to provide optimal learning  environments and experiences. The Milestones are organized into 6 areas of  children&rsquo;s growth that encompass the dimensions of children&rsquo;s overall  development:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Social  and emotional development</li>
  <li>Approaches  to learning</li>
  <li>Language  and literacy</li>
  <li>Cognition  and general knowledge</li>
  <li>Fine  arts, and</li>
  <li>Physical  development and health</li>
</ul>
<p>All  of these areas of development are interrelated, and growth in one area often  influences or depends on development in other areas. No area is more important  than another. To learn more about Virginia&rsquo;s Milestones click <a href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/cc/provider_training_development/intro_page/publications/milestones/milestones_one_document/Milestones_Revised.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Think Something May be Wrong? Who to  contact to have your child screened:</h4>
<p>If  you have concerns about your baby, and would like to request a developmental  screening, you can contact the Infant &amp; Toddler Connection of Virginia at  1-800-234-1448.</p>
<h4>Early Intervention in Virginia</h4>
<p>Early  intervention services are defined as services provided through the Individuals  with Disabilities Act (IDEA) that are designed to meet the developmental needs  of each child and their family, and provided in natural environments for the  child (such as the home or child care setting.) Services are offered through  two distinct programs: Part B (preschool age children 3-5) and Part C (infants  and toddlers 0-2.) To learn more about Early Intervention in Virginia click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-M_P6HrZdA&list=UUDNrV5XsIRCWWN9n7FqGfpA">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Early intervention for Infants and  Toddlers (Part C of IDEA)
</h4>
<p>From  child birth through age 2 a child is eligible to receive services if they have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delayed  functioning</li>
  <li>Exhibit  atypical development or behavior</li>
  <li>Demonstrate  a behavioral disorder that interferes with development, or</li>
  <li>Have  a diagnosed physical or mental condition with a high probability of a resulting  delay (even if no delay currently exists)</li>
</ul>
<p>Early  intervention services are provided by the Infant &amp; Toddler Connection of  Virginia. To learn more, determine if your child is eligible, or find your  local program, click <a href="http://www.infantva.org/">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Early Intervention for Preschool (Part  B of IDEA) </h4>
<p>Preschoolers  may be eligible to receive early intervention services through the Virginia  Department of Education Early Childhood Special Education program if they have  one or more of 14 disability categories such as, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Autism  spectrum disorders</li>
  <li>Learning  or emotional disability</li>
  <li>Visual,  hearing or speech impairment</li>
  <li>Developmental  delay</li>
</ul>
<p>Early  intervention services for preschool aged children are provided by local school  districts.

<h4>Your rights under IDEA </h4>
<p>The  Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) is a federal law that ensures children  with disabilities receive services such as early intervention, special  education, and related programs. Under this law, Parents have specific special  education rights, which are detailed in Virginia&rsquo;s Procedural Safeguards  Notice. To learn more, click <a href="http://doe.virginia.gov/special_ed/regulations/state/procedural_safeguards/english_procedural_safeguards.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Early Childhood Mental Health </h4>
<p>Early  childhood is a critical time for developing the foundations for later emotional  and mental wellness. Adverse experiences have the potential to affect brain  development, and contribute to developmental delays. The foundations for strong  mental health include a safe environment, adequate nutrition, and positive  interactions with care givers. Mental health is part of overall health; a  healthy child has a healthy body and a healthy mind.

<h4>How can you tell if a child care  program is operating illegally?</h4>
<ul>
      <li>A  child day provider may have a business license issued by a locality, but <strong>a business license is not the same as a  license issued by the Department of Social Services</strong>.</li>
      <li><u>Child  day centers</u> are child day  programs offered to (i) two or more children under the age of 13 years in a  facility that is not the residence of the provider or of any of the children in  care or (ii) 13 or more children at any location.  </li>
      <li>Child  day centers must be either<strong> licensed </strong>or<strong> exempt from licensure.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>A center <u>may</u> be operating  illegally if:</h4>
<ul>
      <li>A  current license or exemption letter cannot be produced; or</li>
      <li>There  are more children in care than are allowed by the license or exemption letter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask  the center to show you their license or letter of exemption issued by  VDSS. <br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>Licensed family day homes</u></strong> may  provide care for <strong>six to twelve children</strong> (exclusive of the provider's own children and any children who reside in the  home) when at least one child receives care for compensation. The care may be  offered in the home of the provider or in the home of any of the children in  care. </p>
<h4>A family day home <u>may</u> be  operating illegally if:</h4>
<ul>
      <li>A  current license cannot be produced; </li>
      <li>The  provider or someone who resides in the home is identified as a sex offender or  child abuser;</li>
      <li>There  are more children in care than are allowed by the license; or</li>
      <li>There  are more than four children under the age of two, including the provider&rsquo;s own  children or any children who reside in the home.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ask  the family day home provider to show you their license issued by VDSS.</p>
<ul>
     <li><strong><u>Voluntarily Registered</u></strong><u> <strong>family  day homes</strong></u> are not required  to be licensed, but may choose to be registered. These homes have fewer than  six children in care, not including the provider's own children and any  children who reside in the home. Voluntary registration is not available in  areas where local ordinances regulate unlicensed providers (Arlington, Fairfax,  and Alexandria). </li>
      </ul>

<h4>A voluntarily registered family day  home <u>may</u> be operating illegally if:</h4>
<ul>
      <li>A  current registration letter cannot be produced; </li>
      <li>The  provider or someone who resides in the home is identified as a child abuser or  is registered as a sex offender; or </li>
      <li>There  are more children in care than are allowed by the registration letter.</li>

In its request for certification, the  preschool must specify whether it meets subsection B, C or D of that section of  the Code of Virginia. </li>
</ul>
<h4>A certified preschool <u>may</u> be  operating illegally if:</h4>
<ul>
      <li>A  current certificate cannot be produced; or</li>
