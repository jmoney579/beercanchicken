			<p><a href="http://www.smartbeginnings.org/home/star-quality-initiative/for-early-childhood-professionals.aspx">Virginia Quality</a> is the state&rsquo;s voluntary Quality Rating and Improvement  System. Quality Rating and Improvement Systems are a proven method to improve  the quality of child care and early learning programs. For-profit, nonprofit,  faith-based, VPI and Head Start programs can participate. Virginia Quality  awards quality levels to child care and preschool programs based on four  quality standards and best practices:</p>
			<ol>
			   <li>The  education and qualifications of the staff.</li>
			   <li>The  curriculum or intentional teaching approach the program uses to guide  children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
			   <li>The  learning environment.</li>
			   <li>Teacher-child interactions.</li>
	      </ol>
			<h4>Benefits  of Becoming a Virginia Quality Program</h4>
          <ul>
               <li>Public recognition with  other  high quality child care or  preschool programs in Virginia</li>
               <li>Objective assessment of your  program (based on Nationally recognized best practices/ or standards)</li>

               <li>Access to quality improvement  supports such as  training and technical  assistance</li>
               <li>The satisfaction of offering  high quality services to children and families in your community </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Programs interested in participating in Virginia Quality should contact the regional lead agency in their area. </p>
				<hr class="cc_diamond"/>				
				<h2 id="subsidy">Become a Subsidy Provider</h2>
          <p>The subsidy program provides funding to enhance the quality,  affordability, and supply of child care available to Virginia's families. Child  care programs are child-centered, family-focused services that support the  family goals of economic self-sufficiency and child development by providing  substitute parental care, protection, guidance, and early childhood education. </p>
            <h4>How to become a  Subsidy Vendor</h4>
<p>When a family is approved to receive subsidy assistance they  are able to choose any legally operating provider of child care services.  All providers who wish to receive subsidy  payments must complete the Subsidy Vendor Enrollment Process.<br>
For providers who are licensed or regulated by the VDSS  Division of Licensing Programs, this process is initiated when a family selects  a child care provider.  The case manager  will make a referral to the Subsidy Unit within the Division of Child Care and  Early Childhood Development to begin the enrollment process.</p>
<p>Unlicensed and unregulated providers will be referred by the  local case manager to Child Care Aware of Virginia.  The provider will be contacted directly by  CCA –VA to begin the enrollment process.<br/>
The process may require the provider to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Complete a VDSS Child Care Subsidy Program  Vendor Agreement Packet   </li>
            <li>Provide valid CPR and First Aid Certifications</li>
            <li>Submit to a VA State Police Background Check</li>
            <li>Submit to a CPS Central Registry Check</li>
            <li>Complete a Health &amp; Safety Checklist</li>
            <li>Provide documentation of required annual Skills  Training</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Benefits to becoming  a Subsidy Vendor</h4>
            <p>Approved Subsidy Vendors partner with VDSS to provide  quality child care to all children enrolled in their programs.  Vendors provide safe learning environments  for children in low income families, while focusing on early childhood  development and improving school readiness. Also, families who are approved to  receive subsidy assistance have full parental choice to select any legally  operating child care provider who has also been approved as a Subsidy Vendor.</p>
  <h4>Subsidy reimbursement levels</h4>
<p>Subsidy Vendors are divided into two levels, Level 1 and Level 2.  There are two categories of Level 1 vendors,  Unlicensed and License-Exempt Regulated.   Within each level, there are two types of care, center based or family  day home.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Level 1 Unlicensed Vendors are In-home providers  who are <strong>NOT</strong> licensed or regulated by  VDSS, and Local Government-Approved Recreation Programs.</li>
            <li>Level 1 License-Exempt Regulated Vendors are  providers who are Voluntarily Registered Family Day Homes, Religious-Exempt  Centers and Certified Preschools.</li>
            <li>Level 2 Vendors are providers who are licensed  by VDSS; approved and/or operated by a Licensed Family Day System, the  Department of Education, the Department of Defense, or under local ordinance  according to §15.2-914 of the <em>Code of  Virginia.</em></li>
            <li>The reimbursement received by vendors for  services provided will depend on the Level and type of care.  The Maximum Reimbursable Rates for all  Subsidy Vendors are determined by VDSS.   Level 2 vendor rates are higher than Level 1 rates.  Level 2 vendors are eligible to receive  payment for absences, holidays and to receive payment of registration fees.</li>
          </ul>

		  <h2 id="training">Training &amp; Professional Development</h2>
        <p>A skilled and well trained workforce is essential to  providing high-quality early care and education services to children and their  families.  Through professional  development, child care providers acquire knowledge and skills needed to plan  and implement quality early learning experiences.  If you are a child care provider looking for  professional development opportunities, or other training resources, Virginia  Department of Social Services (VDSS) offers a variety of training, professional  development and resources to help providers get the continuing education and  training needed to be successful in the child care, early childhood education  and school-age workforce.</p>
          <h4>What Training Does  the State Offer?</h4>
<p>The Virginia Department of Social Services (VDSS) Division  of Child Care and Early Childhood Development collaborates with partners to  provide <a href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/family/cc/professionals_resources.cgi">training  opportunities</a> throughout the state for child care and school-age providers  in both classroom-based and distance learning formats. </p>
<h4>VDSS Endorsements</h4>
<p>The endorsement programs are designed to provide a  comprehensive foundation of knowledge for working with children of specific  ages (infants &amp; toddlers, preschool, or school-age.) The endorsement  programs are a collaborative effort between the VDSS, the Virginia Community  College System (VCCS), and the Community College Workforce Alliance (CCWA).  These endorsements can be valuable as entry-level credentials for employment in  the field of early childhood or school age care. These courses can also be used  to meet the training requirements for the Child Development Associate  credential.

          <h4>Inspection of early  care and education programs</h4>
<p>The Virginia  Department of Social Services inspects licensed programs prior to operation,  bi-annually, as needed for program development, and in response to complaints.  The bi-annual mandated inspections are unannounced. <br>
Regulated programs  that are unlicensed are inspected accordingly: </p>
          <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/licensing/recdc/intro_page/applicants/guidance_procedures/information_for_religiously_exempt_child_day_centers.pdf"><strong><em>Religious  Exempt</em></strong></a> child day centers are inspected by VDSS when there is a report of a complaint  and/or allegation. </li>
                <li><a href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/licensing/vrfdh/intro_page/code_regulations/regulations/vr_regulation.pdf"><strong><em>Voluntarily  Registered </em></strong></a><strong></strong>homes are inspected by VDSS prior to issuance of an initial  certificate and prior to issuing a renewal inspection.&nbsp; Registered homes  are inspected when there is a report of a complaint and/or allegation. Annual  monitoring inspections are conducted on a random sampling of homes by contract  agency staff and/or Virginia Department of Social Services staff.  </li>
                <li><a href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/licensing/fds/intro_page/code_regulations/regulations/final_fds_reg_071713.pdf"><strong><em>Family Day  System</em></strong></a><strong></strong> is operated by <a href="http://www.infanttoddler.com">Infant/Toddler  Family Day Care</a> and they are inspected by VDSS.   Individual family day homes approved under the umbrella of the system  are directly inspected by the family day system on a quarterly basis to ensure compliance with the system's policies and  procedures. At least two visits are required to be unannounced. </li>

  <h4>How to tell if a child care program is  operating illegally</h4>
            <p>A child day provider may have a business license issued by a locality,  but <strong>a business license is not the same  as a license issued by the Department of Social Services</strong>.</p>
          <p>Child  day centers are  child day programs offered to (i) two or more children under the age of 13  years in a facility that is not the residence of the provider or of any of the  children in care or (ii) 13 or more children at any location. Child day centers  must be either<strong> licensed </strong>or<strong> exempt from licensure.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A center <u>may</u> be  operating illegally if:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>A current license or exemption letter  cannot be produced; or</li>
              <li>There are more children in care than  are allowed by the license or exemption letter. Ask the center to show you their license or letter of exemption issued  by VDSS.  </li>
              <li><strong>Licensed family day homes</strong> may provide care for <strong>six to twelve children</strong> (exclusive of  the provider's own children and any children who reside in the home) when at  least one child receives care for compensation. The care may be offered in the  home of the provider or in the home of any of the children in care. </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>A family day home <u>may</u> be operating illegally if:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>A current license cannot be produced; </li>
              <li>The provider or someone who resides in  the home is identified as a sex offender or child abuser;</li>
              <li>There are more children in care than are  allowed by the license; or</li>
              <li>There are more than four children under  the age of two, including the provider&rsquo;s own children or any children who  reside in the home. Ask the family day home provider to show you their license  issued by VDSS.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong><u>Voluntarily Registered</u></strong><u> <strong>family  day homes</strong></u> are not  required to be licensed, but may choose to be registered. These homes have  fewer than six children in care, not including the provider's own children and  any children who reside in the home. Voluntary registration is not available in  areas where local ordinances regulate unlicensed providers (Arlington, Fairfax,  and Alexandria). <br>
            <strong>A voluntarily registered family day home <u>may</u> be operating  illegally if:</strong></p>
          <ul>
                <li>A current registration letter cannot be  produced; </li>
                <li>The provider or someone who resides in  the home is identified as a child abuser or is registered as a sex offender; or </li>
                <li>There are more children in care than  are allowed by the registration letter. Ask the family day home provider to  show you their voluntary registration letter issued by VDSS.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong><u>Certified preschools</u></strong> operated  by private schools that are accredited by a statewide accrediting organization  (or another accrediting organization recognized by the Board of Education) are  allowed by <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title63.2/chapter17/section63.2-1717/">Section 63.2-1717</a> of the Code of Virginia to be exempt from  licensure. In its request for certification, the preschool must specify whether  it meets subsection B, C or D of that section of the Code of Virginia. <br>
            <strong>A certified preschool <u>may</u> be operating illegally if:</strong></p>
          <ul>
                <li>A current certificate cannot be  produced; or</li>
                <li>The program does not meet the  requirements in the Code of Virginia. Ask the preschool to show you their  certificate issued by VDSS.</li>
