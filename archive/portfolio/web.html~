      	<h1>Web Development</h1>
        <p>Over the past few years I have been the project lead in overseeing multiple site designs and creations.  Below are a few examples of the work that I have done.  In most of the case the sites were created from scratch without the use of any previous design elements.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2><a href="http://www.eclipseservices.biz">ECLIPSE Electronic Geological Management Systems</a></h2>
        <p>The Eclectronic Geological Management System or EGEMS is a software package developed by ECLIPSE. This is ECLIPSE services first production system eligiable for institutional and private consumer purchase. I was hired to redesign thier current site and develop a more professional appearance. This site incorporates multiple PHP based forms for contact and software purchases made by consumers. Using paypal's linklok system, we (my client and I) developed a secure purchasing site for product sales.</p>
        <p><a rel="lightbox[egems]" title="EGEMS Homepage" href="../images/portfolio_images/EGEMS_Homepage.png"><img src="../images/portfolio_images/EGEMS_Homepage_thumb.jpg" width="189" height="150" alt="EGEMS Homepage" /></a><a rel="lightbox[egems]" title="EGEMS Interior Page" href="../images/portfolio_images/EGEMS_Interiorpage.png"><img src="../images/portfolio_images/EGEMS_Interiorpage_thumb.jpg" width="221" height="150" alt="EGEMS Interior Page" /></a>
        <a rel="lightbox[egems]" title="EGEMS Purchase Form" href="../images/portfolio_images/EGEMS_Purchase_Form.png"><img src="../images/portfolio_images/EGEMS_Purchase_Form_thumb.png" width="156" height="150" alt="EGEMS Purchase Form" /></a></p><p style="clear:both"></p>
<h2><a href="http://www.fdi.vt.edu">Faculty Development Institute</a></h2>
        <p> The Faculty Development Institute at Virginia Tech was established to assists university employee enhance thier professional skills.  Courses ranging from web development to blogging are taught by experts in the field.  As the web development instructor, I was tasked with redesigning the current site.  I can't all of the credit for the design as I started with the globally used template displayed in the second picture:</p>
        <p><a href="../images/portfolio_images/Library_Homepage.jpg"  rel="lightbox[FDI]" title="Library Homepage"><img src="../images/portfolio_images/Library_Homepage_thumb.jpg" width="294" height="200" alt="Virginia Tech Library homepage" /></a>
          <a href="../images/portfolio_images/FDI_Homepage.jpg"  rel="lightbox[FDI]" title="FDI Homepage"><img src="../images/portfolio_images/FDI_Homepage_thumb.jpg" width="281" height="200" alt="FDI Homepage" /></a> <br clear="all" />
</p>
        <h2><a href="http://www.apps.hr.vt.edu/hr/forms/">Human Resources Forms Library</a></h2>
        <p> The Human Resources Forms Library was create to serve as a central repository of all the forms needed to perform the HR functions required internally and externally of the department.  This Library was coded in php and javascript employing a MySQL database on the backend of the application.  Using the library those external to the department can easily search for and locate forms need for the HR required operations.  For those internal to Human Resources, the system allows for uploads of new forms and modifications of current forms.  In addition to management functions, the system also records the use of downloaded form for record keeping and statistical analysis:

        <h2><a href="http://www.vtrhps.org">Tolls of Madness Theater Group</a></h2>
        <p> The Tolls of Madness Theater Group is a student organization primary created to house performances of the Rocky Horror Picture Show in addition to a wide variety of semesterly performaces.  A request was made to have a more up to date website using current development standards.  The site is a relatively simple creation using some grapically designed elements as well as additional javascript coding to create the rotating background and serve galleries from thier picasa account:
          <a href="../images/portfolio_images/RHPS_Home.jpg" rel="lightbox[RHPS]" title="Tolls of Madness Theater Group Homepage"><img src="../images/portfolio_images/RHPS_Home_thumb.jpg" width="239" height="150" alt="Tolls of Madness Homepage" /></a>

        <h2>HokieWellness</h2>
        <p> The hokiewellness site was established to assist with a development project merging the Work/Life Wellness office and the Human Resources office. It's goal was to provide university employee with resources to improve both their physical wellness as well as mental and emotoional wellness.
